"""
Inhibitory winner-take-all LOCKOUT experiment (learning stays ON).

Target mechanism (project owner's spec): while a pattern is dwelt on, the owner
fires, drives L2I, and L2I inhibition removes the OTHER L2E neurons' charge so
they do not fire at all. Once a pattern is owned, rivals go silent -> only the
owner keeps learning -> ownership self-reinforces under continual plasticity (no
freezing needed). The lockout must be per-pattern (each pattern's specialist
locks the rest out), NOT a single universal winner.

Two local ingredients, both default-off, both measured here:
  - v_sat_frac     : bound the L2E membrane near threshold so a rival's charge is
                     small enough for the gate to actually clear it.
  - l2_gate_eq_frac: raise the learnable L2I->L2E gate equilibrium so a discharge
                     can FLOOR a rival to rest (gate ~ membrane, not ~0.15x it).

Metric (learning ON throughout; hold each pattern HOLD_CYCLES cycles):
  - firers/hold  : mean number of DISTINCT L2E that fire during a held pattern.
                   1.0 == perfect lockout (only the owner ever fires). This is the
                   direct read of "no other neuron fires".
  - dominance    : owner's share of cycles during the hold (1.0 == owner every cycle).
  - distinct/N_OUT: distinct owners across the active patterns (want N_OUT -> per-pattern,
                   not one universal king).
  - collisions   : patterns sharing an owner (want 0).
  - dead         : L2E that never won any pattern (secondary).
  - peakV        : peak competition-time membrane, xthreshold (shows charge scale).
