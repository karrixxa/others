"""
Regression test for L2 competition driven by adaptive lateral inhibition.

Background: L2 used to resolve competition with a procedural hard reset -- when
one neuron fired, every other L2E was forced to resting potential the same step.
That destroyed the subthreshold charge losing neurons had accumulated across
volleys, so only one neuron ever fired, only it ever learned, and every pattern
collapsed onto that single winner.

The fix routes suppression through the real L2I->L2E pathway instead: when
several L2E cross threshold together, one fires and drives the shared inhibitory
neuron L2I, which laterally inhibits the OTHER threshold-crossers (near-winners)
through an adaptive gate (Neuron.apply_inhibition). Subthreshold accumulators are
left untouched, so every unit can eventually win, and the gate strengths are
learned rather than hand-tuned.

This test asserts the collapse is gone: multiple neurons fire, multiple patterns
map to distinct winners, L2I actually mediates the competition, and the gates
adapt away from their initial value.
