"""
Focused test for the L1I immediate-relay feedback mode (l1i_immediate_relay).

In this mode L1I is a deterministic feedback relay, NOT a trainable
threshold-integrating neuron: any L1I that receives a nonzero L2E feedback signal
fires in that same outer timestep, regardless of its learned threshold or its
feedback-weight training. The contract pinned here:

  * Default ON: a fresh engine has l1i_immediate_relay == True.
  * On the step an L2E winner fires, EVERY L1I fires -- even when L1I is sabotaged
    (feedback weights zeroed, threshold set impossibly high) so that the legacy
    integrator could never cross threshold. This proves the firing decision does
    not depend on membrane accumulation, learned threshold, or weight training.
  * With no L2E winner (no nonzero feedback) L1I does NOT fire.
  * Flag OFF restores the integrator: under the same sabotage L1I never fires on
    that step.
