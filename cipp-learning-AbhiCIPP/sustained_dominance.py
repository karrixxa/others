Sustained-presentation dominance harness -- the HONEST one-to-one metric.

Unlike metrics_consolidation.py (which presents each pattern for a single short
window per sweep and takes the modal winner ACROSS sweeps -- a measurement
artifact that only ever sees the specialist's reliable first-cycle-after-switch
win), this harness HOLDS each pattern continuously for many cycles and records
one winner PER CYCLE. That exposes the round-robin: even when 8/8 distinct modal
specialists exist, rivals can still take most cycles under sustained input.

Protocol (per seed, per condition):
  1. Build SimulationEngine(seed, subtractive_reset=<cond>).
  2. Interleaved-train `epochs` sweeps; each sweep presents every pattern for
     `cycle_period` steps (learning stays on throughout -- the local rules never
     switch off).
  3. For each pattern: hold it for cycle_period * HOLD_CYCLES steps and record the
     L2E that fired each cycle (exactly one competition resolves per cycle).
  4. Report distinct modal winners / 8, mean sustained dominance, per-pattern
     modal winner + dominance, and dead-L2E count.

Compares baseline (subtractive_reset=False) vs experiment (True) across seeds.

FINDING (see AGENT_HANDOFF.md sec 5-6): at the default refractory=2, subtractive
reset is INERT -- the winner fires far above threshold (~19k-26k vs an 8k
threshold) and fire() does leave it a large residual, but update()'s refractory
clamp forces the membrane back to rest for the whole refractory period, erasing
the residual on the same step. Baseline and experiment come out byte-identical.
Only at refractory=0 (no clamp) does the residual survive, and there it trades a
small dominance gain for a large distinctness collapse (8 -> ~5.5 distinct) --
the same margin-vs-distinctness frontier documented in the handoff. So this
mechanism, as specified, does NOT deliver sustained one-to-one ownership. The
refractory sweep at the bottom of the run makes the masking self-documenting.
