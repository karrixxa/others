* dynamic fan-in via ``add_input_connection()`` + ``finalize_connections()`` for
  column construction where wiring is assembled in stages.

        Independent second learning system (the excitatory rule in _update_weights

        is any afferent with a negative weight, acting as an adaptive suppression
