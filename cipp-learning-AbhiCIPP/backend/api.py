# Dashboard config: homeostasis OFF so the fixed weight_budget (= threshold_l2)
# governs each L2E's total feedforward weight -- receptive fields concentrate to
# large, visible values instead of being shrunk by homeostatic scaling. A faster
# L2E learning rate sharpens them.
# The dashboard runs the MINIMAL SIGNED-SPIKE experiment by default (see
# Claude_Minimal_Signed_Spike_Learning_Prompt.md and the README section). The
# feedforward rule is the signed one -- on fire, active inputs (+1) potentiate and
# inactive inputs (-1) depress, dw = eta*p*(1-(w/w_cap)^2)*signal, no weight budget
# -- and every compensating mechanism is off so the core local loop is what you
# see: charge -> fire -> local signed update -> learned L2I lateral inhibition ->
# L1I feedback inhibition -> repeat. refractory=0 (inhibition, not a hard lockout,
# regulates frequency). Toggle any of these live in the "Model Config" panel.
#
# The exact override values now live in backend/presets.py
# (DASHBOARD_ENGINE_OVERRIDES) so this module and single_pattern_diagnostic.py
# cannot drift apart -- see that module's docstring and test_presets.py for the
# identity guarantee. Consolidation-stack rationale (loser depression + assembly
# flow credit sharing one clock off L2I's own discharge; l2i_lr_frac kept at its
# default 0.01 since a faster E->I rate destabilizes L2I) is documented there.
