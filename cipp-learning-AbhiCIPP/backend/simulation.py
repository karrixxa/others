SimulationEngine -- steppable wrapper around the spiking network.

Spikes are delivered immediately (no conduction delays). Every neuron has a
3D position for display; the L2 positions in L2_HOMES remain so the layout
is meaningful in the viewport, but they no longer imply any timing.

Learning architecture:
  - L1E neurons are treated as pre-trained pixel encoders: weights are fixed
    at [-1.0, 1.0] and learning_rate = 0.  They fire whenever the external
    pixel is active and they are not suppressed by their paired L1I neuron.
  - L2E neurons carry a homeostatic weight budget equal to the threshold.
    Only their positive (feedforward) incoming weights are counted; the
    inhibitory index-0 weight is excluded.  As learning strengthens active
    synapses, the budget normalisation weakens the others, producing
    competitive receptive-field emergence.
  - L1I / L2I (inhibitory) neurons carry NO budget.  Instead, each
    individual incoming weight is capped independently (no renormalization
    trades one synapse off against another), and BOTH follow the identical
    two-regime "assembly evidence integrator" policy, just scaled to their
    own layer's threshold (see the L2 / L1 competition note below for the
    full mechanism): every synapse is randomly initialized (never a repeated
    constant) at [0.25, 0.5] of its own neuron's threshold -- L1I from
    [0.25, 0.5] * thr_l1 (L1_EI_WEIGHT_INIT_LOW/_HIGH_FRAC), L2I from
    [0.25, 0.5] * threshold_l2 (L2_EI_WEIGHT_INIT_LOW/_HIGH_FRAC) -- and each
    synapse's LEARNING ceiling is that same neuron's own threshold (thr_l1 /
    threshold_l2), not a separate fixed constant. This lets timing dynamics
    train freely without distorting receptive fields.

With slow leak_l2 (~0.01) and small initial feedforward weights, L2E neurons
require many volleys to fire at first (classic LIF accumulation).  As
synapses specialise, they fire from a single volley (pattern integrator).
The charge-ring visualisation makes this transition directly observable.

L1 / L2 competition (source of winner-take-all, and of L1's feedback
suppression):
  Both inhibitory neurons -- L1I (one per pixel) and the shared L2I -- are
  "assembly evidence integrators" whose own behavior changes across training
  in two regimes, identically in mechanism, only differing in which
  threshold and which leak rate govern them (thr_l1/L1I_LEAK_RATE for L1I,
  threshold_l2/L2I_LEAK_RATE for L2I):
    EARLY -- each incoming synapse starts randomly well below that neuron's
    own threshold, and a fast membrane leak (much faster than the
    corresponding excitatory layer's leak_l1/leak_l2) sets a short
    evidence-retention window of a few volleys, so the inhibitory neuron only
    fires once several DIFFERENT excitatory neurons have spiked within that
    window and their contributions sum toward threshold -- a "round robin"
    phase where no single source is yet trusted. (The fraction/leak-rate pair
    is chosen so this ceiling -- w/(1-r) for a geometric series of
    volley-spaced contributions -- sits comfortably ABOVE threshold, not
    below it: raising a threshold without also scaling the weight range and/or
    leak rate can push the target past that ceiling entirely, making the
    round-robin phase permanently unreachable rather than merely slower --
    see L2I_Temporal_Integration.md for the full derivation.)
    LATER -- these synapses are not budgeted and each is individually capped
    at its own neuron's threshold (not a fixed sub-threshold ceiling), so as
    the existing, unmodified Hebbian rule repeatedly credits whichever
    excitatory neuron habitually co-occurs with a discharge, that synapse can
    grow all the way to threshold and become sufficient alone -- one spike
    from that now-trusted source then fires the inhibitory neuron
    immediately, the same LIF-accumulator -> pattern-integrator transition
    L2E itself goes through.
  Whenever L2I fires (either regime) it laterally inhibits the rest of the L2
  pool through the L2I->L2E gate (see Neuron.apply_inhibition); whenever an
  L1I fires it suppresses its paired L1E the same way. NOTE: L1I no longer uses
  the trainable-integrator regime by default -- with l1i_immediate_relay (default
  ON, see step() 2e) L1I is an immediate deterministic relay that fires on any
  nonzero L2E feedback, since the learned integrator was not useful and its
  accumulation introduced a feedback phase shift. The two-regime accumulator
  below still applies to L2I, and to L1I only when the relay flag is turned off. Subthreshold L2E
  neurons are left untouched, so charge accumulated across volleys is
  preserved and every unit can eventually win. Each L2I->L2E gate's strength
  is learned per neuron by the inhibitory-plasticity rule and saturates below
  threshold, so L2 competition self-organizes and cannot collapse to a
  permanent single winner. (An earlier version reset all non-winners to rest
  each step, which destroyed subthreshold evidence and locked the network to
  one neuron; a version after that let a single L2E spike fire L2I
  immediately from t=0 with no round-robin phase at all, and L1I was an
  instant integrator from t=0 the whole time -- see
  L2I_Temporal_Integration.md, now superseded by the two-regime design above,
  applied uniformly to both L1I and L2I.)

# L2E->L2I "assembly evidence" synapses.
#
# Two regimes, by design, not by accident:
#   EARLY in training, no single L2E->L2I synapse is anywhere near enough on
#   its own (see L2_EI_WEIGHT_INIT_LOW/_HIGH_FRAC: the random init range is
#   well below threshold_l2), so L2I only fires once several distinct L2E neurons
#   have spiked within its short retention window (L2I_LEAK_RATE). This is
#   what produces the initial "round robin": no one source is trusted yet, so
#   competition is decided by population consensus, not a single vote.
#   OVER TRAINING, the L2E->L2I weights are NOT budgeted (weight_budget=None,
#   homeostasis off for L2I) and each synapse's cap is the neuron's OWN
#   threshold_l2 (not a fixed sub-threshold ceiling) -- so as the existing,
#   unmodified Hebbian rule repeatedly credits the synapse from whichever L2E
#   habitually wins (and therefore habitually co-occurs with L2I's discharge
#   cycle: L2E fires -> L2I fires -> that L2E gets inhibited, repeat), that
#   one synapse can grow all the way up to threshold_l2 and become
#   sufficient on its own: once it has, a single spike from that specific,
#   now-trusted source fires L2I immediately, matching L2E's own transition
#   from many-volley LIF accumulation to single-volley pattern-integrator
#   firing (see the module docstring). The temporal-integration REQUIREMENT
#   (multiple contributors) is therefore a property of an undertrained
#   synapse, not a permanent structural ceiling -- see L2I_Temporal_Integration.md
#   for the original (now superseded) design that made it permanent.
# L2I_LEAK_RATE is still much faster than leak_l2 (L2E's slow, many-volley
# accumulator): L2I needs a SHORT retention window so that only spikes from
# roughly the same "burst" of population activity sum together while the
# synapses are still weak, while isolated single-neuron spikes decay away
# before a second volley's worth of unrelated evidence could pad them out.
#
# The init range is expressed as a FRACTION of threshold_l2, not an absolute
# constant, because the achievable ceiling of the round-robin phase depends on
# both together: with volley-spaced contributions decaying by r=(1-leak)^4
# per gap, n same-size contributions sum to at most w/(1-r) as n -> infinity
# (a geometric series). With L2I_LEAK_RATE=0.07, r=(0.93)^4~=0.748, so that
# ceiling is w/0.252 ~= 3.97*w -- population consensus can only ever ratchet
# threshold_l2 to just under 4*(the init weight), REGARDLESS of how many
# volleys pass. The mean init weight must therefore scale with threshold_l2
# (not stay fixed) or raising the threshold alone can make the ceiling fall
# below threshold_l2, at which point L2I could never fire at all via the
# round-robin route -- and since L2I's own E->I weights only update on ITS
# OWN fire, it would then never learn either (a silently dead network, not
# merely a slow one). [0.25, 0.5] * threshold_l2 keeps the same relative
# dynamics validated in L2I_Temporal_Integration.md (a single contribution at
# ~37.5% of threshold; 4 volley-spaced contributions needed to cross) at
# whatever threshold_l2 is actually configured to.

# immediately, with no round-robin phase and nothing left for the existing
# Hebbian rule to actually move). Now: synapses start randomly in
